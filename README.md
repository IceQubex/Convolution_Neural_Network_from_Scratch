# Convolution Neural Network from Scratch
Implemented a convolutional neural network from scratch, with convolutional layers, max-pool layers and dense layers. Fully functional with forward and backward propagation methods, with weight updates done using gradient descent. Tested on a custom dataset with various hand gesture images, which were preprocessed manually.
